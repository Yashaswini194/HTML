    <h1>eBooks: A Digital Revolution</h1>
    <p>
        eBooks are the digital format of printed books available on computers and handheld electronic devices and include texts and images and sometimes audio, video, and various links to websites. Generally, eBooks are purchased through the internet, but some are accessible for free.

        In 1971, Michael S. Hart digitized the U.S. Declaration of Independence and provided the worldâ€™s first eBook on Project Gutenberg. During 1997-98, Rocket eBook and Softbook were launched as eBook readers. In 2007, Amazon launched its Kindle eBook reader in the U.S. and gained worldwide appreciation as it made book reading easier. The publishing industry has been trying to cope with modern technologies as the number of tech-savvy people is increasing. Digital publishers are gaining much importance nowadays with the advent of eBooks. They are assigned to digitize and transform the physical form of books into digital form.

        eBooks are generally cheaper than paperbacks and hardcovers, but eBook licenses are more costly. These can be downloaded directly on computers or devices after the purchase. Also, various online libraries provide free access to eBooks to the public through their websites. This started with the American Library Association in 1998.

        A large proportion of the population prefers printed books in paperback and hardcover editions over eBooks. With the gradual technological advancements, people are nowadays getting interested in the idea of eBooks. Individuals can have one eBook reader and can access all the books available on this platform. Also, eBooks can be shared through the internet easily and have multiple users. eBooks have great scope for further developments and universal acceptability. The digital publishers are trying to improve the content by adding more features like read-aloud, hyperlinks, audio and visual effects, like 3D figures or even GRE calculators. Ten years from now, most books will have an electronic version and can be accessed on portable devices.
